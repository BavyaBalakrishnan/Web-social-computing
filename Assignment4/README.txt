Problem Statement: Demonstrate the usefulness of all the concepts studied and experimented with in the previous assignments by applying it to large-scale COVID-19 graph data (of India or any other country that is majorly affected; Indian data available for download from https://api.covid19india.org/).
We used the daily data from January 30, 2020 to June 04, 2020. 
Language: Python
Libraries: networkx,numpy,matplotlib,ast
Each node in the graph represent patient/district/state/ based on available information. Each vertex has the attributes such as age,gender,State,Current status,Type of Transmission
and weight. Weight of each vertex indicate the number of patients. We have analysed the various properties of Covid graph considering both directed and undirected versions.
