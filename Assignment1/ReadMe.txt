Part 1

Designed an information network analysis strategy for measuring the various network properties listed below.
1. Degree distribution
2. Diameter
3. Geodesic path length
4. Clustering coefficient & average clustering coefficient
5. Strongly connected components
6. SCC their properties
7. Sparseness
8. 1-connectedness to k-connectedness; what is k for your graph?

Part2

For the sample network data considered for the earlier experiments, applied the Erdos Renyi Model, Watts-Strogatz Model and Barabasi Albert Model and verified the inherent properties exhibited by the graph data.
