WSC Assignment 3
------------------
1. For the different sized networks that you used for Assignment 1, implement the normalized metrics used to measure centrality of nodes - Degree centrality, Closeness centrality, Betweenness centrality and Eigenvector centrality. 
2. To implement   (i) HITS algorithm   (ii)  PageRank algorithm

The implementation is done in Python language using Networkx library.
Code files are,
centrality.py : Calculating the  Degree centrality, Closeness centrality, Betweenness centrality and Eigenvector centrality of 4 different sized networks and plotting the distribution of centralities.
pagerank.py   : Calculating the Page ranks of 4 different networks of various sizes and plotting the Page rank distribution. Results are copied to results.txt file.
HITS.py       : Calculating the Hubs-Authorities scores of 4 different networks of various sizes and plotting the Hubs-Authorities score distribution.

Datasets and Images are present in separate folders.

Detailed report with observation and analysis is also included.
